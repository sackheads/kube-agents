# Unit tests for every Python helper outside k8s-operator/, which has its own
# target. Mostly stdlib-only -- the skill helpers shell out to gh/kubectl
# rather than importing SDKs -- but the agent scripts do import a few third
# party packages; CI installs those (.github/workflows/python-tests.yml) and
# a local run needs them on the path too.
#
# The wildcards are what keep this honest: a new skill's tests are picked up
# without editing this file. Five globs rather than one because the tests do
# not all live under skills -- the agent scripts the skills share, the Chat
# Agent plugins, the image patches and the repository's own tooling in
# scripts/ each hold their own. That last one is here because it was not: the
# tests for the upstream-skill sync sat in scripts/ outside every glob, so
# they had never once run in CI. Discovery is then run once per directory
# rather than once over the tree, because none of them are packages --
# `unittest discover` pointed at agents/platform/skills finds nothing and
# still exits 0, which reads as a passing suite.

# The security invariants, as executable assertions. Deliberately not folded
