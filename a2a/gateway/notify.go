// The chat.notify route: proactive posts (alerts, cron findings, audit
// reports) from the platform agent to the install's home channel, with no
// inbound message to answer. Under spec.mode next the Hermes chat platform
// that used to carry them is off, and the gateway is the one process holding
// the chat credential.
//
// A notify is not a task. It mints no capability, starts no executor, opens no
// session and carries no authority block: it is text the agent could already
// post through `hermes send` on a today install, now posted by the process
// that owns the backend. What bounds it is where it may land - the configured
// home space only, a new thread there or a reply on one of that space's
// threads - and who may send it, which is the bus grant: the agent principal
// publishes chat.notify.<backend>, the gateway alone subscribes, and the answer
// travels on chat.notify.reply.agent.>, which only the gateway may publish and
// only the agent may read (platformagent_a2a_identities.go). The answer does
// not go to the requester's _INBOX for the reason the verifier's does not: the
// agent reads its JetStream replies there, and a gateway able to publish into
// it could forge them.
