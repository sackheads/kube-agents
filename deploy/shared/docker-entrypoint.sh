# 2.6 Force-sync the image-managed persona and config files of the specialist
# profiles so they ALWAYS track the image, not the persistent PVC — the same
# guarantee step 2a gives the default profile. The scaffold in 2.5 only runs when
# a profile is ABSENT, so without this an existing platform/cluster profile on
# the PVC keeps stale personas after an image roll.
#
# The platform profile also force-syncs config.yaml, the cluster profiles do NOT,
# and that asymmetry is deliberate:
#   - The platform config.yaml is entirely image-owned — built at image build
#     time by merging the shared defaults with the platform overlay. `hermes
#     profile create` emits no config.yaml, and nothing writes to
#     profiles/platform/config.yaml at runtime (step 3's otel injection targets
#     only the default profile; the platform template already enables
#     hermes_otel). Without syncing it, an image that changes the platform's
#     toolsets or plugins has no effect on any existing deployment.
#   - A cluster config.yaml is identity-stamped at scaffold time with that
#     cluster's `cluster_identity` block (project/cluster/location), so it is
#     runtime state. Overwriting it from the template would strip the record
#     cluster_agent_reconcile.py matches a profile to its cluster by, and the
#     reconciler would then scaffold a duplicate profile it can never prune.
#     (KUBECONFIG is not in this file — it is pinned in the profile's .env by
#     cluster_agent_profile.py:_pin_kubeconfig_env.)
#
# Profile identity is NOT at risk either way: `hermes profile create` records the
# name and description in profiles/<name>/profile.yaml, a separate file that no
# template ships, so it is never overwritten here. Per-profile runtime state
# (USER.md, memory/, sessions/) is likewise left untouched.
#
# The sync goes through profile_scaffold.py --items rather than a `cp -f` loop
# because the list is no longer files-only: cron/, skills/, and governance/ carry
# the machinery CAPABILITIES.md advertises. `[ -f ]` is false for a directory, so
# naming them in a shell loop would be a silent no-op — an upgraded install would
# take the new CAPABILITIES.md and none of what it describes. --items copies each
# entry with copytree(dirs_exist_ok=True), which handles both. The profile already
# exists here, so the scaffold's `hermes profile create` is a no-op and only the
# overlay runs; --plugins is deliberately omitted (step 2.5 owns that).
#
# cron/jobs.json is the one entry that is merged rather than replaced, inside
# profile_scaffold.py. It is image-owned and runtime state in the same file: the
# schedules, prompts and `enabled` flags ship in the image, but the scheduler
# writes each job's run history back into it and the operator can add jobs of
# its own. Copying it wholesale erased both on every pod restart, which let a
# daily audit fire a second time the same morning. The merge is per key — the
# image wins every key it ships, the volume keeps every key it does not — so
# flipping `enabled` to false in the image still disables a watchdog.
#
# Known limit: the overlay adds and overwrites, it never prunes. A skill or SOP
# dropped from the image stays on the PVC until an operator removes it by hand.
# That is the deliberate trade — this path must not start silently deleting from
# a user's volume — not an oversight.
# Gated on profile.yaml, not on the directory: a bare mount point is not a profile, and
# dressing one in a persona and a config makes it indistinguishable from a real profile at
# the next start — which is how a half-built profile used to become permanent.

# force-syncs it from the image, and the operator has no copy of the image-built merge
# to reproduce), so it emits an overlay per profile and this step merges it in.
