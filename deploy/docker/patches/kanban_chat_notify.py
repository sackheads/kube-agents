"""Deliver kanban card events to a chat platform the A2A gateway holds, through chat.notify.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/kanban_chat_notify.py`` and
wired into ``gateway/kanban_watchers_notifier.py`` by
``deploy/docker/patches/apply_kanban_chat_notify.py``.

The gap
-------
Under ``spec.mode: next`` the operator does not render the Hermes Google Chat
platform: the A2A gateway consumes the Chat backend. A card an alert's triage
creates still subscribes to the alert's Google Chat thread
(``kanban_event_routing`` resolves the api_server session to it), and the
notifier only collects subscriptions whose platform has a connected adapter
(``_Collector.active_platforms``). So every such subscription is skipped,
silently, on every tick: no claim, no failure count, no unsubscribe, and the
card's report never reaches the thread.

The fix
-------
The operator names the platform the gateway holds in ``A2A_NOTIFY_PLATFORM``
(the same switch ``agents/platform/scripts/chat_notify.py`` reads). For that
platform, and only inside the notifier:

1. :func:`active_platforms` counts it as served, so its subscriptions are
   collected.
2. :func:`resolve` hands delivery a :class:`ChatNotifyAdapter` when no live
   adapter answers for a subscription that names a thread. The stand-in posts
   with ``a2a notify``, which asks the gateway to post into that thread over its
   chat.notify route.
3. :func:`fresh_events` drops, from a claim, events that were already older
   than :data:`STALE_EVENT_SECONDS` when routed delivery first went live, so
   the first rollout does not replay the backlog every skipped subscription
   accumulated; the cursor still advances past them. The moment is kept under
   ``$HERMES_HOME`` (the agent's volume), so this is a one-time skip: an
   outage after the rollout delays events, and drops none.

Only the subscription's thread is forwarded, and the gateway posts only into
threads of the home channel, so a thread of another space is refused (and the
notifier drops that subscription after its consecutive-failure limit, as for
any destination that cannot be reached). A subscription with no thread (a DM,
or a space as a whole) is not delivered at all: posting it as a new thread in
the home channel would move text meant for one space into another.

When the route is not there (the gateway restarting, its route unarmed, the
bus unreachable: ``a2a notify`` exit 4), :func:`resolve` answers no adapter,
which is upstream's disconnected-adapter path: skipped without a claim and
without spending the failure budget. It learns this from a probe (an empty
notify, which an armed gateway refuses at once; a failure the gateway did not
answer, such as a login the auth callout could not decide, also reads as down)
that the collector's pre-claim
authorization runs on its worker thread, and from any send that meets exit
4. An up answer is trusted for :data:`ROUTE_PROBE_TTL_SECONDS`; a down one
holds the route down for :data:`ROUTE_DOWN_BACKOFF_SECONDS` and is probed
again after it. So a send that meets an outage inside that window spends one
unit, and marks the route down for the rest. Without this a gateway roll
would unsubscribe every card with a pending event.

The stand-in is never registered in ``runner.adapters``, so nothing else in the
gateway believes the platform is connected, and it is not offered under
``multiplex_profiles``, where upstream's ``None`` can be a deliberate refusal
rather than an absent adapter. It is a full ``BasePlatformAdapter`` so the
notifier's failure wakes re-enter the creator's thread through
``handle_message``; the runner cannot resolve this adapter mid-turn, so typing,
streaming and tool progress are skipped and only the turn's final reply comes
back, through ``send``. ``edit_message`` is left at the base default
(unsupported), which tells the rolling progress line to post each note anew;
attachments are not posted (there is no file route), and say so in the log.
