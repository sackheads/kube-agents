"""Verify the kanban_chat_notify patch against the patched Hermes tree.

Run from ``/opt/hermes`` by ``deploy/docker/Dockerfile`` after
``apply_kanban_chat_notify.py``. It imports the real patched notifier and
exercises what the patch adds, so a base-image bump that changes what
``_Collector``, ``_adapter_for_subscription`` or the wake path look like fails
the build here rather than on a live install. A fake ``a2a`` on PATH stands in
for the CLI from the first routed resolve on.

1. Resolution: with ``A2A_NOTIFY_PLATFORM`` set and no Google Chat adapter
   connected, a collector counts ``google_chat`` as served and
   ``_adapter_for_subscription`` returns the stand-in, reused across
   deliveries and never registered in ``runner.adapters``; with it unset,
   neither happens. A threadless subscription and ``multiplex_profiles`` get
   none, and the collector's claim is wrapped by the stale filter.
2. Send: ``a2a notify`` with the thread and a ``--`` before the text; exit 0
   is sent, exit 1 failed, exit 3 (outcome unknown) not a failure, and exit 4
   a failure that holds the route down.
3. The route probe: an empty notify; exit 4 reads as down before any send,
   an armed gateway's refusal as up.
4. Attachments are not posted.
5. A failure wake is admitted, reaches the runner's handler, and the turn's
   reply goes out through ``a2a notify``.
