// Slice 2a closed `--kuberc` in the command policy and then found that kubectl
// honours $HOME/.kube/kuberc with no flag present. That default path is closed
// by `KUBECTL_KUBERC=false` in the executor environment (asserted in
// test_credential_proxy.py) and, underneath it, by the broker's HOME living on
// a volume the agent cannot write. The second half was accidental: nothing
// asserted it, so a plausible rearrangement of the mounts — pointing
// CREDENTIAL_PROXY_STATE_DIR at the PVC so the kubeconfig cache survives a
// restart, say, or mounting the state volume into the agent for debugging —
// would have removed it silently. This is that assertion.
//
// It deliberately checks which volume backs the path rather than comparing the
// state directory and the workspace root as strings. Container mounts shadow,
// so a state directory lexically inside the workspace can still be backed by
// the emptyDir; the volume is the fact, the path arithmetic is not. Found by
// mutation: moving CREDENTIAL_PROXY_STATE_DIR and its mount to
// /opt/data/credential-proxy leaves this green, and correctly so — the emptyDir
// still shadows that path inside the broker container, so the agent's writes
// underneath the PVC are invisible to the broker.
//
// That layout is not harmless, though, and the reason is worth keeping here
// because it is not what this test guards. With the state dir under the
// workspace root, the broker's own HOME becomes lexically inside the
// _within_workspace containment root (credential_proxy.py), so an
// agent-supplied cwd could name it and a proxied git could run there. Nothing
// does this today and nothing proposes to; it is a reason not to, not a bug.
