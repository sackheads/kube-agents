# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Who is calling
#
# For as long as the broker ran as a sidecar, nothing on this path
# authenticated anything.  What kept the credentials safe was geometry: Envoy
# bound 127.0.0.1, so only the Pod could reach it, and the socket behind Envoy
# was 0600 in an emptyDir that only this container mounted.  Both of those
# properties are properties of *sharing a network namespace*, and both
# evaporate the moment the broker becomes its own Pod.  So a split needs an
# answer to "who is calling", and this is it.
#
# The answer is a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token, projected into the caller
# with a dedicated audience, presented as a bearer token, and verified here
# with a TokenReview against the API server.  Three reasons for that shape
# rather than mTLS or a Unix socket per caller:
#
#   * It needs no PKI.  This repository has no cert-manager for workloads, no
#     service mesh and no SPIFFE; mTLS would mean standing all of that up, or
#     minting certificates in the operator, before a single request could be
#     authenticated.  The projected token already exists in the cluster.
#   * It needs no Envoy filter.  The Envoy config is baked into the image and
#     loaded by absolute path, so an ext_authz or JWT filter is an image
#     rebuild that cannot vary per agent.  A bearer header rides through the
#     router filter untouched and is checked here, in code the operator can
#     configure with an environment variable.
#   * It forecloses nothing.  mTLS is a transport underneath this, not a
#     replacement for it: adding a client certificate later leaves the request
#     shape, the handler and this verifier intact, and gives ``Principal`` a
#     second, stronger source for the same field.  gRPC carries bearer
#     credentials in exactly the same ``authorization`` metadata key, so a
#     later move to gRPC ports the identity model verbatim.  What it does
#     foreclose is a Unix socket per caller — but a Unix socket needs a shared
#     filesystem, which is the one thing splitting the Pods takes away.
#
# What it is honestly *not*: encryption.  The token crosses the cluster
# network in cleartext, exactly as the github-token-minter call already does
# (see github_token_refresh.py).  Anyone who can observe pod-to-pod traffic in
# the namespace can replay it until it expires.  mTLS closes that, and the
# NetworkPolicy work in the next task narrows who can open the connection at
# all.  Neither is done here.

class Principal:
    """Who the broker believes is on the other end of a request.

    ``workload`` is what the transport can prove today: the Kubernetes identity
    of the ServiceAccount whose projected token authenticated the connection.

    Read that literally — it is **per-ServiceAccount**, and weaker than
    per-Pod. The agent Pod and the broker Pod run as the same ServiceAccount,
    because the Workload Identity IAM binding names it and giving the agent one
    of its own would take the broker's cloud credentials with it. So this field
    excludes every other workload in the cluster and nothing finer: it cannot
    distinguish the agent Pod from the broker Pod, let alone one session inside
    the agent Pod from another. It answers "which ServiceAccount", not "which
    Pod" and not "on whose behalf".

    ``caller`` is the seam for slice 3, and it is deliberately a field on the
    object rather than a second parameter threaded through the handler. When
    the per-caller identity model is settled, the agent obtains a capability
    token scoped to one session — minted by whatever authority slice 3 lands
    on, and *attenuating*, so it can never name more authority than the
    workload token it was exchanged for — and sends it alongside the workload
    token. This class grows one more verification step that populates
    ``caller`` from it, ``authenticate`` keeps its signature, and the policy
    layer downstream reads ``principal.caller`` where it reads
    ``principal.workload`` today. Nothing about the request shape, the
    handler, or the operator's rendering has to change again.
    ``caller`` stays None until then, and the invariant that matters (A3) is
    that neither field is ever derived from the request body — from ``argv``,
    from ``cwd``, from anything a model produced. Both come from a token the
    API server verified.

# Config keys forced onto every git invocation, as the `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`
# layer. That layer outranks system, global and repo-local config, which is
# the point: the agent owns the working tree, so `.git/config` is a file it
# can write, and every key below turns a string in that file into a command
# the credential holder executes.
#
#   core.hooksPath   `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is executed by `git commit`, and
#                    `git commit` is a verb the skills issue nine times.
#                    Pinning the path also neutralises hooks installed into a
#                    fresh clone through `init.templateDir`.
#   core.fsmonitor   run by `git status`, i.e. by a read verb.
#
# **This list is known-incomplete and is not a boundary.** `filter.<name>.smudge`
# and `alias.<name>` reach the same place and cannot be pinned, because the key
# contains an arbitrary name and there is nothing to enumerate. They are open,
# they are recorded as open, and the fix for the class is to stop executing
# subprocesses in a directory the agent controls at all (content-passing).
# What this buys is blast radius, not closure — do not read it as more.
#
# Only keys whose "off" value is a *working* value belong here. `diff.external`
# was pinned to "" in an earlier revision and reverted: git does not read an
# empty value as "no external diff", it tries to execute the empty string, so
# every `git diff` died with `fatal: external diff died` — a read verb broken
# by the hardening, reported in a way that reads as a broken image rather than
# a refusal. There is no value that turns it off, and since anyone who can
# write the `.git/config` that sets it can equally use the two unpinnable keys
# above, the pin cost a working verb and removed no capability from an
# attacker who has that write.
#   commit.gpgsign   turns `git commit -m` — the argv the skills already send —
#   gpg.program      into a run of whatever `gpg.program` names. Signing is a
#   tag.gpgSign      program git executes, and both halves are settable from
#                    `.git/config`. Note the failure shape: the payload runs and
#                    *then* git exits 128, so a test asserting only a non-zero
#                    exit would have called this working.
#   help.autocorrect Without it the subcommand refusal list below is not a
#                    control at all: set it in `.git/config` and `git bisct run`
#                    resolves to `bisect run`, matching nothing on a list that
#                    compares whole tokens. Pinned to 0 — never autocorrect —

    the only kind of bug this project has shipped.

    1. `--flag=value`, handled by splitting on the first `=`.
    2. `-Ovalue` and `-iOvalue`, the attached and clustered short forms,

    3. **`--fl`, an abbreviation.** git's *subcommand* options go through
       parse-options, which accepts any unambiguous prefix, so `git rebase
       --exe <cmd>` and `git config --glo alias.zz '!<cmd>'` both run. Both

    An argument is refused when it is a prefix of a refused option, which is
    strictly more conservative than git: git takes a prefix only when it is
    unambiguous among the options that subcommand defines, and this does not
    know the subcommand. Deliberately so — deciding ambiguity here would mean
    reimplementing parse-options and agreeing with it forever. The cost is
    refusing `--g`, `--ex` and the like as literal arguments, which nothing
