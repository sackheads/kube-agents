## What the agent can and cannot do

This is the canonical answer. Other pages summarize it and link here; if they appear to disagree, this page is correct.

"Is the agent read-only?" has **three different answers depending on which plane you mean.** Conflating them is the most common misreading of this project's security posture.

| Plane                         | What it governs                                                   | Can the agent write?                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kubernetes RBAC** (the KSA) | Everything the agent does against a cluster's Kubernetes API      | **No** for workloads and cluster state — read-only in every configuration apart from a leader-election housekeeping Role confined to its own namespace, and it cannot read Secrets. Enforced by RBAC. |
| **GCP IAM** (the GSA)         | GKE/Google Cloud control-plane calls, including via the `gke` MCP | **No, with the default `read-only` permission set** — the only other set the provisioner offers is `custom`, whose roles you choose yourself. Enforced by IAM, chosen at provisioning.                |
| **The GitOps path**           | Changes to your infrastructure-as-code repository                 | Yes — by opening a pull request a human must review and merge.                                                                                                                                        |

### What that means in practice

- **Workloads and cluster state cannot be mutated through the Kubernetes API by this agent.** The KSA's only write grant is the housekeeping Role `kubeagents:leader:<namespace>:<name>` — write on leader-election `leases` plus `get`/`patch` on `pods`, both confined to the agent's own namespace. Beyond that it holds no write verb (see [Kubernetes RBAC](#kubernetes-rbac)). This holds regardless of any other setting.
- **GCP control-plane mutation is enforced off by default.** The default `read-only` permission set gives the GSA viewer roles only, so cloud-side writes fail at IAM. The provisioner no longer offers an admin bundle — `custom` is the only way to widen this, and it requires you to name every role. If you do grant write roles that way, the agent's `gke` MCP server proxies `container.googleapis.com` and exposes cluster-management tools, and what stops the agent using them is its **persona** (`SOUL.md §1`, "automation first" — infrastructure changes go through Git), not a permission boundary.
- **Persona rules are guidance, not enforcement.** A prompt-injection or reasoning failure is bounded by IAM, not by `SOUL.md`. Keep the default `read-only` set if "read-only on the cloud plane" must be an enforced property of the deployment rather than an intended behaviour of the model (see [Configuring read-only mode](#configuring-read-only-auditing-mode)).
- **The intended write path is always GitOps** — the agent proposes, a human merges, your reconciler applies. See [Secure write path](#secure-write-path-gitops).
- **The chat front door holds no infrastructure tools at all.** Chat ingress terminates at the Chat Agent (the pod's `default` Hermes profile), whose config pins every surface to routing, kanban-delegation, and per-user memory tools only — no GKE, file, or GitOps write tools. A prompt injected through chat must still be delegated to the Platform Agent, where the IAM and RBAC boundaries above apply. See [ChatOps](/kube-agents/concepts/chatops/).
- **Cluster Agents are scoped-down, not scoped-up.** Each per-cluster [Cluster Agent](/kube-agents/concepts/cluster-agents/) profile shares the pod's identity (same KSA/GSA, so the same IAM and RBAC ceilings apply), but its config template exposes only the read-only `gke` and `developer_knowledge` MCP servers — no `platform_control`, no GitOps write path — and its `KUBECONFIG` is pinned to one cluster. It proposes fixes back over the kanban card; only the Platform Agent can turn them into PRs.

> The [end-state design](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/architecture/01-vision-scope.md) goes further: agents stay read-only on cloud APIs in every configuration, and the `create_cluster` tool is withdrawn. Removing the `gke-admin` bundle closes the one-word path to a writable GSA, but it does not get there on its own — `custom` can still be pointed at admin roles, and the tool is still present. That part is a target, not current behaviour.

The rest of this page details the two enforced planes.

## Identity model

The agent uses [GKE Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) to bind its in-cluster KSA to a GSA, so no static GCP key ever lands in the cluster.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph K8s["GKE cluster"]
        Pod["Platform Agent pod"] --> KSA["KSA<br/>kubeagents-platform-agent"]
    end
    subgraph IAM["GCP IAM"]
        KSA -->|Workload Identity| GSA["GSA<br/>kubeagents-platform-gsa@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
        GSA -->|IAM roles| Res["GCP / GKE resources"]
    end
```

The IAM side of the binding is pre-provisioned by [`provision_04_gcp_iam.sh`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/scripts/provision_04_gcp_iam.sh), which grants `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` on the GSA to the KSA member `<project>.svc.id.goog[kubeagents-system/kubeagents-platform-agent]`. The KSA-side annotation `iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: kubeagents-platform-gsa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` is applied by the operator from `spec.security.serviceAccountAnnotations` on the [`PlatformAgent` CR](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/).

## GCP IAM permission sets

`provision_04_gcp_iam.sh` grants the agent GSA one of two permission sets, chosen with the `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET` variable (prompted during provisioning, cached in `vars.sh`):

| Permission set | `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET` | Use it when                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **read-only**  | `read-only` (default)           | Auditing / monitoring only — no GCP write capability.         |
| **custom**     | `custom`                        | You supply the exact roles via `PLATFORM_AGENT_CUSTOM_ROLES`. |

### Roles per set

The default **read-only** set binds viewer roles only:

- `roles/container.clusterViewer`, `roles/container.viewer` — read-only GKE.
- `roles/monitoring.viewer`, `roles/logging.viewer` — read-only telemetry.
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` — act as service accounts when running jobs.
- `roles/iam.securityReviewer` — read IAM policy for review.
- `roles/mcp.toolUser` — call the GKE MCP server.

The **custom** set binds exactly the roles listed in `PLATFORM_AGENT_CUSTOM_ROLES` (space- or comma-separated; the provisioner prompts for it and requires a non-empty value when this set is selected) — none of the built-in role bundles are added.

### Why there is no `gke-admin` set

There used to be a third set, `gke-admin`, which bound `roles/container.clusterAdmin` and `roles/container.admin`. It was removed because it did not simply widen the ceiling — it removed one:

- **GKE authorizes on the union of IAM and Kubernetes RBAC.** A GSA holding `roles/container.admin` is authorized by IAM whatever the KSA's RBAC says, so the read-only Kubernetes footprint below stops constraining anything the agent reaches through that identity.
- **`roles/container.admin` carries `container.clusters.impersonate`, and IAM has no `resourceNames` equivalent for it.** Granting the role therefore grants impersonation of any principal on any cluster in the project, which is not something the grant can be scoped down to.

`custom` remains, so a deployment that genuinely needs broad roles still has a supported path — it just has to name each role, which makes the grant explicit and reviewable. Setting `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET=gke-admin` now fails the provisioning step with an error rather than being silently downgraded.

## Kubernetes RBAC

Independently of the GCP permission set, the operator grants the agent KSA a **read-only** footprint on the Kubernetes API, plus one namespaced housekeeping Role. It creates three bindings (see [`platformagent_manifests.go`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go)):

| Binding                                  | Role                         | Grants                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kubeagents:viewer:<namespace>:<name>`   | standard `view` ClusterRole  | Read access to most namespaced resources — **excluding Secrets**.                                                                          |
| `kubeagents:explorer:<namespace>:<name>` | custom `kubeagents:explorer` | `get`/`list` on `nodes`, `pods`, `namespaces`, and CRDs.                                                                                   |
| `kubeagents:leader:<namespace>:<name>`   | custom namespaced Role       | Housekeeping in the agent's **own namespace only**: write on `coordination.k8s.io` `leases` (leader election) and `get`/`patch` on `pods`. |

For the default CR (`platform-agent` in `kubeagents-system`) the bindings resolve to `kubeagents:viewer:kubeagents-system:platform-agent`, `kubeagents:explorer:kubeagents-system:platform-agent`, and `kubeagents:leader:kubeagents-system:platform-agent`.

The `viewer` and `explorer` roles carry no write verb (`create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`) and cannot read Secrets. The only write grant anywhere is the `leader` Role, and it is confined to the agent's own namespace — leader-election `leases`, plus `get`/`patch` on `pods` there. The agent cannot modify Deployments, Services, or namespaces, and it cannot read Secret values — if a resource it proposes needs a Secret, it references the Secret by name rather than reading its contents.

Verify the bindings on a running cluster:

```bash
kubectl describe clusterrolebinding kubeagents:viewer:kubeagents-system:platform-agent
kubectl describe clusterrolebinding kubeagents:explorer:kubeagents-system:platform-agent
kubectl describe rolebinding -n kubeagents-system kubeagents:leader:kubeagents-system:platform-agent
```

### The admission backstop on agent RBAC

The RBAC above is what the operator creates. Two cluster-scoped `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` objects reject agent RBAC that goes beyond it at apply time, whoever applies it — the operator, your GitOps reconciler, or a human with `kubectl`. One source, [`k8s-operator/config/admission/agent-rbac-policy.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/config/admission/agent-rbac-policy.yaml), and **which installs apply it depends on how you install**:

| Install method                                                   | Ships the policies?                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automated GCP provisioning (`provision.sh`, INSTALL.md Method 1) | **Yes** — `provision_03_gcp_gke_operator.sh` applies the source.                                        |
| Helm chart, on its own or via Terraform (Method 4)               | **Yes** — `templates/agent-rbac-admission-policy.yaml`, gated on `admissionPolicy.enabled`, default on. |
| Manual `make install && make deploy` (Method 2)                  | **No** — apply the source yourself; INSTALL.md Method 2 Step 4 has the command.                         |

They are outside the kustomize overlay on purpose: its `namePrefix` rewrites each policy's name but not the `spec.policyName` its binding refers to, which would leave the bindings pointing at nothing and the policies inert with no error. A plain `kubectl apply` has no such transform.

They need Kubernetes 1.30 or later. Below that the chart install fails (turn the gate off), and the provisioning script warns and continues without them — but only when it has confirmed the cluster genuinely lacks the API; if it cannot reach the cluster to find out, it fails the step rather than guess.

| Policy                            | Governs                                                                          | Denies                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `kube-agents-agent-readonly`      | `Role` / `ClusterRole` labelled `kube-agents/tier`                               | Any verb outside `get`/`list`/`watch`; any rule reaching `secrets`; a `ClusterRole` for the `developer-team` tier. |
| `kube-agents-agent-binding-scope` | `RoleBinding` / `ClusterRoleBinding` whose subject is a `*-agent` ServiceAccount | A `ClusterRoleBinding` to `developer-team-agent`.                                                                  |

What they do **not** cover, stated plainly because a backstop misread as complete is worse than none:

- **They cannot check the role a binding points at.** CEL in a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` sees only the object being admitted, so an unlabelled write `Role` bound to an agent ServiceAccount is admitted. Closing that needs a cross-object webhook, which is not built.
- **The content policy is label-selected.** `kube-agents-agent-readonly` only looks at objects carrying `kube-agents/tier`. A hand-written manifest that omits the label is not examined at all; pull-request review is what catches that. The binding-scope policy is not evadable this way — it keys on the ServiceAccount being privileged, which the binding cannot omit.
- **They govern agent RBAC, not the operator's own.** The controller's ClusterRole below is unlabelled and out of scope by design.

### The operator controller is a separate identity

Everything above describes the _agent_. The controller-manager that reconciles `PlatformAgent` CRs runs under its own KSA, `kubeagents-controller` (the kustomize `namePrefix: kubeagents-` applied to the base `controller` ServiceAccount), and its Kubernetes permissions are the Kubebuilder-generated ClusterRole in [`k8s-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/k8s-operator/config/rbac/role.yaml) (regenerated with `make manifests`): write access to the object kinds it reconciles for the agent pod — Deployments/StatefulSets, ServiceAccounts, Services, ConfigMaps, PVCs, NetworkPolicies, and the agent RBAC objects above — plus read-only access to what it merely watches (nodes, namespaces, CRDs, RuntimeClasses). Unlike the agent, the controller has no GCP identity: no provisioning step creates a controller GSA or Workload Identity binding for it (the `CONTROLLER_GSA_NAME` default in `scripts/common.sh` is consumed only by the teardown scripts, which clean up older installs that did bind one).

## Configuring read-only (auditing) mode

`read-only` is the provisioning default, so a fresh install already runs in this posture. To pin it explicitly, or to bring a deployment provisioned with the removed `gke-admin` set back to it:

- **With the provisioner (recommended)** — accept the default `read-only` permission set when `provision_04_gcp_iam.sh` prompts, or set it up front:

  ```bash
  cd k8s-operator/scripts
  PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET=read-only ./provision_04_gcp_iam.sh
  ```

- **On an existing GSA provisioned with the old `gke-admin` set** — re-running the provisioner will not strip roles it no longer grants, so swap the admin roles for viewers by hand:

  ```bash
  PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
  GSA_EMAIL="kubeagents-platform-gsa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

  # Remove the admin roles
  for role in roles/container.clusterAdmin roles/container.admin roles/monitoring.admin; do
    gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
      --member="serviceAccount:${GSA_EMAIL}" --role="${role}"
  done

  # Add the read-only roles
  for role in roles/container.clusterViewer roles/container.viewer roles/monitoring.viewer; do
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${PROJECT_ID}" \
      --member="serviceAccount:${GSA_EMAIL}" --role="${role}"
  done
  ```

  Leave `roles/logging.viewer`, `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`, `roles/iam.securityReviewer`, and `roles/mcp.toolUser` in place — they are shared by both sets.

The Kubernetes RBAC above is already read-only in every mode, so no cluster-side change is needed.

## Secure write path: GitOps

Because the agent's Kubernetes RBAC is read-only, remediations are proposed rather than applied:

1. The agent invokes the [`submit-suggestion`](/kube-agents/concepts/declarative-workflow/) skill with a proposed diff — or, for a scheduled fleet audit, the `fleet-audit` skill with a validated findings file.
2. The skill's helper commits to a topic branch and calls [Minty](/kube-agents/deploy/token-minter/) for a short-lived GitHub App token.
3. It opens a Pull Request against your GitOps repository. `fleet-audit` publishes its report as one GitHub issue per audit stream — the ledger, rewritten in place each run — and opens a narrow Pull Request only for a finding whose fix is a manifest, linked back to that ledger.
4. A human reviews and merges; a GitOps controller (Argo CD, Flux) reconciles the change into the cluster.

Both paths share the same guardrails: blanket staging (`git add .` / `git add -A`) is refused, and force-pushes to `main`, `master`, and `production` are hard-blocked.

The agent never has direct write access to running infrastructure — see [Declarative workflow](/kube-agents/concepts/declarative-workflow/).

## Change control & safety

- **No direct cluster writes.** Enforced by RBAC (above) and by the persona's automation-first stance — the agent does not `kubectl apply`; it opens PRs. See [Platform Agent](/kube-agents/concepts/platform-agent/).
- **No credentials in the sandbox.** API keys, chat tokens, and ServiceAccount tokens live only in the Envoy credential-proxy sidecar; the agent container gets wrapper CLIs that forward through a policy-enforced local proxy. See [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).

  **This is a filesystem and environment boundary, not a network one, and the default install does not close it.** The sidecar shares a Pod — and therefore a network namespace and one Pod identity — with the sandbox, so the agent container can reach the link-local metadata server at `169.254.169.254` and mint the Workload Identity service account's token itself, bypassing the proxy and every command policy in front of it. Two opt-in fields close that path, `spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod` and `spec.security.egressPolicy: Allowlist`, and **both default to off**. What they cost, what they break, and what to check on the cluster first are on [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/#denying-the-sandbox-the-metadata-server), which owns the topic.

- **One agent per project.** The admission webhook rejects a second `PlatformAgent` CR, so a cluster can't accumulate agents with overlapping scope. See [PlatformAgent CRD](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/).
- **Human sign-off for destructive ops.** Cluster deletion, tenant offboarding, and broad IAM revocation always require explicit human approval, regardless of any "just do it" phrasing.
- **Bounded recovery.** The agent retries a blocker through its recovery ladder (roughly five iterations or ~10 minutes) before escalating to a human instead of looping indefinitely.
- **Read-only log access by default.** Provisioning grants the agent `roles/logging.viewer`, not admin — it cannot tamper with the audit-log sink. `provision_04_gcp_iam.sh` also actively reconciles away any legacy `roles/logging.admin` grant on the GSA unless a custom role set explicitly requests it. Stronger environments should route an immutable log copy to a separate security project (see [User attribution](/kube-agents/reference/attribution/#trust-boundary)).
- **`AgentPlugin` create/update is an administrative privilege.** Treat the permission to create an `AgentPlugin` as equivalent to running code inside the agent pod, because that is what it does. The plugin's OCI image is mounted into the agent container and Hermes imports it, so the plugin executes with the agent's ServiceAccount, its Workload Identity binding, and its access to the credential proxy. The controls below constrain what a plugin can declare _in the CR_; none of them sandbox the plugin code itself. Restrict `agentplugins` RBAC to the same set of principals you would trust to change the agent's container image.

  The controls that do apply, and their exact scope:
  - **Opt-in `agentRef` targeting.** A plugin must set `spec.agentRef` to a `PlatformAgent.metadata.name` in its own namespace. Plugins whose `agentRef` does not match are ignored — a plugin cannot attach itself to every agent by omitting the field.
  - **`spec.targetProfile` chooses which agent's toolset the plugin sits beside.** It does not widen the trust boundary — plugin code already runs in the agent pod with its ServiceAccount, whichever profile loads it — but it does decide the company it keeps. A plugin left on the default profile loads into the Chat Agent, which is deliberately stripped of terminal, file, and code-execution tools. Targeting `platform` loads it into the Platform Agent instead, alongside `gcloud`, `kubectl`, and the GitOps write path, and makes its skills resolvable to the agent that holds them. Review a plugin that targets a privileged profile with that in mind, and note that `spec.config` cannot reach the `agent` subtree from either place, so a plugin still cannot raise its own retry or iteration budget.
  - **Name restriction.** `metadata.name` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*$` (max 56 characters), enforced by a CEL rule on the CRD. The name becomes both the mount directory and the module identifier Hermes imports.
  - **Config subtree allowlisting.** Only the top-level keys `approvals`, `platforms`, and `platform_toolsets` are merged from `spec.config`; every other key is dropped and logged. This keeps a plugin out of `agent` (including `agent.disabled_toolsets`), `leader_election`, `logging`, and `plugins`. It does **not** make the merge safe in general — see the two caveats below.
  - **Caveat: allowlisted subtrees still carry security weight.** `approvals` governs approval gating and `platform_toolsets` gates which toolsets a platform surface exposes. A plugin may set values under both. Allowlisting bounds _where_ a plugin can write, not _how much authority_ it can grant itself.
  - **Caveat: list merges are additive.** When a plugin supplies a list under an allowlisted key, its entries are unioned into the operator's list rather than replacing it. A plugin can therefore add a toolset to `platform_toolsets` but cannot remove one the operator configured.
  - **`spec.env` overrides operator-set variables.** Plugin-supplied environment variables take precedence over variables of the same name set by the operator, and secret references resolve against any Secret in the agent's namespace. The one exception is `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL`, which the operator appends after the merge so a plugin cannot redirect the credential proxy. Secrets referenced this way land in the agent container's environment: this is a supported way to supply a plugin its own API token, not a preservation of the credential-proxy boundary, which only covers the credentials the proxy itself brokers. See [Credential isolation](/kube-agents/reference/credential-isolation/).

## Where to go next

- [PlatformAgent CRD](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/) — `spec.security` and the permission set field.
- [User attribution](/kube-agents/reference/attribution/) — tracing an action back to the human who requested it.
- [Provisioning scripts](/kube-agents/operator/provisioning-scripts/) — where the IAM and RBAC are laid down.
- [`docs/security-requirements.md`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/docs/security-requirements.md) — the provider-neutral security configuration model: the permission / interaction / authorization dimensions, what is current behaviour versus planned capability, and the acceptance criteria.
