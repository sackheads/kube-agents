# PlatformAgent Credential Isolation

## Summary

### Goal

The PlatformAgent sandbox container must not receive API keys, access tokens,
refresh tokens, or Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens through its environment or
filesystem.

Credential values returned by an approved tool call are an accepted risk. For
example, an approved `gcloud auth print-access-token` response may expose a
token to the agent. Preventing that disclosure is not part of this design.

### Design

Each PlatformAgent runs as one long-lived Pod with these managed containers:

1. `platform-agent`: the untrusted agent sandbox.
2. `platform-agent-dashboard`: the optional local dashboard.
3. `fluent-bit`: log forwarding.
4. `event-watcher`: cluster-event forwarding using a non-secret internal key.
5. `envoy-credential-proxy`: Envoy plus the credentialed command and chat
   runtime.

The sandbox calls wrappers for `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `gh`, and `git`. Wrappers
send a structured argument vector to Envoy at `127.0.0.1:8765`. Envoy forwards
requests over a private Unix socket to the credential runtime. Slack and Google
Chat use the same local relay.

Only trusted sidecars receive projected Kubernetes ServiceAccount (KSA) tokens.
The credential sidecar receives secret environment variables, credential state,
and its identity token. The event watcher receives a separate Kubernetes-API
token, CA, and namespace projection. Neither token is mounted in the agent or
dashboard containers. (`spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod: true` is the
exception, and the only one: it mounts a third, audience-bound token into the
agent container so the agent can authenticate to the broker across the network.
Every unqualified "the sandbox holds no token" claim below describes the
sidecar layout.) The credential sidecar also authenticates callers of the
PlatformAgent API before forwarding requests with a non-secret internal
sentinel. Pod-wide automatic KSA token mounting is disabled.

### Guarantee

In the sidecar layout the operator does not place managed credentials in the
sandbox container's:

- environment;
- root filesystem;
- persistent agent volume; or
- mounted ServiceAccount token path.

The last of those four is given up under
`spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod: true`, which mounts a projected
ServiceAccount token in the sandbox deliberately; the other three hold in both
layouts.

`spec.deployment.env` is applied to the credential sidecar because it may
contain credentials. Four allowlisted OpenTelemetry settings may also be copied
to the sandbox, but only as literal values; all `valueFrom` sources are rejected.
Reserved proxy, runtime-loader, and shell-startup variables cannot override the
operator's managed values.

### Limitation

Containers in one Pod share a network namespace and one Pod identity. The
sandbox does not have the KSA token file, but it can technically reach the GKE
metadata server used by the credential sidecar. A Pod-level NetworkPolicy
cannot block metadata for one container while allowing it for another.

This design therefore meets the scoped filesystem-and-environment goal, but it
does not provide the stronger identity boundary of separate Pods. It assumes
the agent does not deliberately request credentials from the metadata server.

That assumption is no longer the only thing available, but it is still what the
default install runs on. `spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod` moves the
broker into a Pod of its own, and `spec.security.egressPolicy: Allowlist` then
renders a default-deny egress NetworkPolicy on the agent Pod that denies the
metadata server by not listing it. Both default to false, the second is refused
outright without the first, and neither does anything on a cluster whose CNI
does not enforce NetworkPolicy. See
[Denying the sandbox the metadata server](site/src/content/docs/reference/credential-isolation.md#denying-the-sandbox-the-metadata-server).

## Scope

### In scope

- PlatformAgent only.
- Credentials managed by the operator.
- CLI forwarding for `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `gh`, and `git`.
- Slack and Google Chat credentialed relays.
- PlatformAgent API bearer-key termination in the credential sidecar.
- GitHub installation tokens minted through Minty.
- Sidecar health, lifecycle, rollout, and migration from the former proxy Pod.

### Out of scope

- Preventing credentials from appearing in approved command or tool output.
- Preventing an approved credentialed command from deliberately copying a
  credential into the shared workspace. Such credential disclosure and tool
  side effects require a separate approval/policy design.
- Preventing deliberate access to the shared Pod identity or metadata server.
- Arbitrary user-supplied init containers, sidecars, volumes, and mounts. These
  are trusted configuration and may intentionally weaken isolation.
- OperatorAgent and DevTeamAgent.
- General data-exfiltration prevention.

## Architecture

```text
PlatformAgent Pod

  platform-agent
    credential-free env and mounts
    CLI wrappers / chat adapters
              |
              | HTTP on 127.0.0.1:8765
              v
  envoy-credential-proxy
    Envoy listener
              |
              | private Unix socket
              v
    credential runtime
    real CLIs, Slack/Chat clients, Minty client
    secret env, KSA token, private temporary state
```

Envoy is the only listener for credentialed tool and chat requests. The
credential runtime listens on a Unix socket mounted only in the sidecar, so the
sandbox cannot bypass Envoy by calling the runtime directly. A separate sidecar
listener authenticates the existing PlatformAgent API on port 8643 and forwards
to the sandbox API on loopback using a non-secret sentinel.

The containers have the same lifecycle because they are part of the same
Deployment and Pod. If the sidecar is not ready, the Pod is not ready. If either
Envoy or the credential runtime exits, the sidecar exits and Kubernetes restarts
it.

## Credential Placement

| Data                            | Sandbox     | Credential sidecar        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `spec.deployment.env`           | No          | Yes                       |
| Slack tokens                    | No          | Yes, Secret-backed env    |
| PlatformAgent external API key  | No          | Yes, Secret-backed env    |
| Automatic KSA token mount       | Disabled    | Disabled                  |
| Explicit projected KSA token    | Not mounted | Read-only, one-hour token |
| gcloud/kubectl configuration    | No          | Private `emptyDir`        |
| GitHub installation token/cache | No          | Private `emptyDir`        |
| Agent workspace                 | Yes         | Yes, for proxied commands |

The projected token uses the audience `kubeagents-credential-proxy`, expires
after one hour, and is mounted only at
`/var/run/secrets/kubeagents/serviceaccount/token` in the credential sidecar.
The table above describes the sidecar layout; under
`spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod: true` a token with the same audience
is also mounted read-only in the sandbox, because that is how the agent
authenticates to a broker that is no longer on loopback.
The event watcher has a separate one-hour token with the Kubernetes API's
default audience, plus the cluster CA and Pod namespace, at the conventional
in-cluster path. It is not shared with the sandbox or dashboard.
Deleting a default token during startup is intentionally not used: projected
tokens rotate, and mount-time exclusion is reliable.

## Request Paths

### CLI commands

The sandbox image contains wrapper binaries instead of credential-aware CLI
binaries. A wrapper sends the executable name and argument array to the local
proxy. The credential runtime directly executes the corresponding real CLI and
returns output and exit status. It never evaluates an agent-supplied shell
command.

Only `gcloud`, `kubectl`, `gh`, and `git` are accepted. The proxy also rejects
known credential-disclosure, credential-replacement, and self-modification
operations. Pipelines and redirections are interpreted by the sandbox shell
around an individual wrapper invocation, so they cannot execute inside the
credential sidecar. Requests that cannot be represented safely fail closed,
including:

- interactive TTY programs and password prompts;
- arbitrary binary or unbounded streaming input/output;
- file paths that refer to sandbox-only files;
- background processes or commands that outlive the request; and
- commands exceeding request, output, or timeout limits.

Standard input and full-duplex streaming require a future bounded protocol; the
wrapper does not silently consume an inherited protocol stream.

The current deny policy applies regular expressions to a shell-escaped rendering
of the argument vector and permits flags before or between subcommands. This is
an interim policy mechanism, not a general shell parser. If the policy grows
beyond these narrowly defined commands, it should use tool-specific argument
parsers over the structured argument vector.

### git configuration

A kubeconfig is not the only executable configuration the agent can author.
`git` selects both its transport and several helper programs from configuration
files, and it reads those from the shared workspace volume as well as from the
credential runtime's own home directory. Left at its defaults, a `git` the
sandbox requested can therefore name a program for the credential runtime to
execute, without the argument vector containing anything the deny policy would
match — the argv is only ever `git commit`.

The runtime consequently overrides those defaults for every command it runs,
through the environment rather than through a configuration file, so that the
settings cannot be edited by anything holding the volume:

- the transport allowlist is restricted to `https`, which git honors above the
  equivalent setting from every configuration file, including one supplied on
  the command line;
- the system configuration file is suppressed and the global configuration file
  is pinned to a path inside the runtime's private `emptyDir`. It is pinned
  rather than disabled because `gh auth setup-git` installs the GitHub
  credential helper by writing that file;
- the hooks directory is pinned to an empty, non-writable directory, which also
  neutralizes hooks installed into a fresh clone from a template directory; and
- the filesystem monitor, which names a program and is invoked by a read-only
  verb, is disabled.

Only settings whose disabled value is a working value are pinned this way. There
is no value of `diff.external` that means "no external diff" — git executes an
empty value — so pinning it replaces one code-execution setting with a `git diff`
that always fails, and it is deliberately not pinned.

The runtime additionally refuses, in the argument vector, the global options that
would undo the above: `-c` and `--config-env`, which set configuration ranking
above the pinned values; `--exec-path`, which selects the directory git executes
`git-<subcommand>` from; `--git-dir` and `--work-tree`, which identify a
repository directly and so bypass the containment check applied to the request's
working directory; and `--global` and `--system`, which write the configuration
files being pinned. `-C` remains accepted because the containment check resolves
it, and repository-local `git config` remains accepted because that is how a
clone's commit identity is set. Also refused are the subcommands whose function
is to execute a caller-named command — `bisect` (`bisect run`), `difftool`
(`--extcmd`), `mergetool`, `filter-branch` (`--tree-filter`), `send-email`
(`--smtp-server`), `instaweb`, `web--browse`, `fast-import`, and the `p4` and
`svn` bridges. Refusals are reported as `SECURITY_POLICY_BLOCKED` with rule
`git.argument.refused`. No shipped skill uses any of them; every skill clone,
fetch and push uses an `https` URL built from a fixed prefix.

**Limitation.** Two gaps remain and both are consequences of the same thing —
the runtime executing inside a directory the sandbox owns.

The pins do not extend to configuration stored in a repository's own
`.git/config`, which the sandbox authors and which git consults for settings that
name a program to run. Some such settings can be pinned and are; others take an
arbitrary name within the key (`filter.<name>.smudge`, `alias.<name>`) and
therefore cannot be enumerated at all.

The refused-subcommand list is likewise a denylist over a set that is not closed:
git holds a command in configuration for several tools, and a future release may
add another. Allowlisting the subcommands the product issues, and failing closed
on the rest, is the structurally correct form and is the recommended follow-up.

Reducing both is the motivation for having the runtime receive file content from
the sandbox rather than operate inside a directory the sandbox controls; until
that lands, a cloned working tree is sandbox-controlled input and not a trust
boundary.

### Agent-supplied kubeconfigs

A Cluster Agent profile pins itself to one cluster through `KUBECONFIG`, and
that file lives on the shared workspace volume, which the credential sidecar
also mounts. The sandbox can therefore choose the document a credentialed
`kubectl` opens.

A kubeconfig is executable configuration rather than data. Left unconstrained it
offers the sandbox several ways past the boundary this design establishes:

- `users[].user.exec.command` and `users[].user.auth-provider.config.cmd-path`
  run a program inside the credential sidecar, next to the credentials;
- `clusters[].cluster.server` and `proxy-url` choose where the access token
  minted by `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` is sent, with `certificate-authority-data`
  supplied by the same author so TLS still validates;
- `users[].user.tokenFile` reads a sidecar file of the author's choosing and
  sends its contents as the bearer token; and
- `insecure-skip-tls-verify` removes the remaining obstacle to the above.

None of this is visible to the deny policy described above, which matches
against the argument vector — the argv is only ever `kubectl get pods`.
Validating the document instead would mean maintaining a denylist over a format
that keeps growing, and would not hold regardless: the sandbox can rewrite the
file between the check and the open.

The proxy therefore treats an agent-supplied kubeconfig as a **name, not as
content**. This is possible because the sandbox never legitimately authors one.
Every kubeconfig the system uses is produced by `gcloud container clusters
get-credentials`, which already runs in the sidecar. The proxy reads exactly one
string out of the caller's file — `current-context` — accepts it only if it is a
well-formed `gke_<project>_<location>_<cluster>` name, and regenerates the
kubeconfig itself into a directory backed by a sidecar-only `emptyDir`. That
regenerated file is what every proxied command runs against. No field the
sandbox wrote is ever interpreted, and there is no check-then-open window,
because the sandbox never had a handle on the document that is opened.

The same substitution is applied to a `--kubeconfig` flag in the argument
vector, which `kubectl` prefers over the environment; covering only the
environment would leave the flag as an equivalent path. `get-credentials` is
handled as the one command permitted to author a kubeconfig: it writes into the
sidecar's own directory, the result is filed under the context it selects, and a
copy is then written to the workspace path the caller asked for. The visible pin
that profile scaffolding records and the Cluster Agent preflight inspects
therefore still exists, without being what a later command opens.

Consequences:

- Naming a cluster is not additional authority. `get-credentials` is bound by
  the same Workload Identity the sidecar already holds, so the sandbox can only
  name clusters that identity could already reach.
- Only GKE contexts are supported, because the context name is what makes
  regeneration possible. A pin the proxy cannot regenerate from — no
  `current-context`, a non-GKE context name, or a merged `path1:path2` list — is
  rejected with `400` rather than honored.
- A cache miss costs one `get-credentials`. The common paths warm the cache
  themselves, since profile scaffolding and context switching both begin with
  that command.
- `current-context` is read with a real YAML parser, so a valid kubeconfig in
  any legal spelling is recognized, but deliberately with PyYAML's pure-Python
  `safe_load`. The C loader recurses in C and terminates the sidecar with
  `SIGSEGV` on a deeply nested document, where the Python loader raises a
  catchable error. The input is chosen by the sandbox, so this is a
  denial-of-service boundary rather than a performance choice.

### Chat

Slack and Google Chat adapters send credential-free request payloads to Envoy.
The credential runtime owns platform tokens and performs the external API call.
Allowlisted users, payload size limits, and file size limits are enforced by the
relay.

### PlatformAgent API

The Kubernetes Service sends API traffic to port 8643 on the credential
sidecar. The sidecar validates the configured external bearer key and replaces
it with the sandbox's fixed, non-secret sentinel before forwarding to port 8642.
Existing API clients retain bearer-key authentication without placing the real
key in the sandbox.

### GitHub and Minty

The credential sidecar obtains a Google OIDC identity token and calls Minty.
Minty validates CEL authorization rules for the authenticated agent identity and
requested repository, then brokers a repository-scoped GitHub installation
token with a maximum one-hour lifetime. The GitHub App private key remains in
Cloud KMS and signing uses `AsymmetricSign`.

The workspace is mounted at the same path in both containers so proxied Git
commands operate on the agent's repository. Git authentication, CLI config, and
token caches remain on a separate sidecar-only volume. The sandbox receives
only command output, never a mounted Git credential file.

## Kubernetes Details

- The Pod uses the configured PlatformAgent KSA for the credential sidecar's
  Workload Identity.
- `automountServiceAccountToken: false` applies to the Pod.
- Separate projected ServiceAccount token volumes are mounted only by the
  credential sidecar and event watcher; neither is mounted by the agent or
  dashboard containers. Under `spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod: true`
  the agent container does mount one — the broker-audience token it presents
  to the broker Service.
- Secret and credential-state volumes are mounted only by the credential
  sidecar.
- The sandbox and sidecar run non-root, drop all Linux capabilities, disallow
  privilege escalation, and use the runtime-default seccomp profile.
- The Pod never sets `shareProcessNamespace`, and the two containers run as
  different users: the sandbox as UID 10000, the `hermes` user the agent image's
  files belong to, and the sidecar as UID 10001. Neither `/proc` nor a file mode
  hands the sandbox the sidecar's environment.
- Both keep GID 10000, which is also the Pod `fsGroup`. The workspace PVC is
  mounted in both and each writes files the other has to change — the sandbox
  creates the leased GitOps directory the sidecar clones into, the sidecar writes
  the kubeconfig pin into a profile home the sandbox created — so both
  entrypoints run with `umask 0002`. Files that predate the UID split are made
  group-writable by the kubelet's `fsGroup` pass at every mount.
- The credential sidecar root filesystem is read-only; writable state uses
  bounded `emptyDir` volumes.
- A policy ConfigMap hash is placed on the Pod template to trigger rollout when
  command policy changes.
- The operator reports Ready only when the combined Pod is ready.

## Deployment and Migration

The operator creates the sandbox and Envoy credential sidecar together in the
existing `<agent>-gateway` Deployment and retains the existing `<agent>-data`
PVC — unless `spec.security.splitCredentialBrokerPod` is enabled, in which case
the credential runtime is rendered as its own `<agent>-credential-proxy`
Deployment and Service instead of as a sidecar. Before the sandbox starts, a
managed init container removes legacy gcloud, GitHub, Git, Kubernetes, AWS,
Azure, Docker, npm, and Python credential files from that PVC. This preserves
agent state without carrying credentials forward from an older deployment. It
deletes operator-owned resources from the abandoned two-Pod design:

- `<agent>-sandbox` Deployment; and
- `<agent>-sandbox` ServiceAccount.

Deletion refuses to remove resources not owned by the PlatformAgent.

Three names that used to be on that list are no longer deleted, and the
difference is load-bearing. `<agent>-credential-proxy` Deployment and Service
are not legacy any more: they are exactly what the operator renders under
`splitCredentialBrokerPod: true`, and it owns them in both directions —
applied while the flag is on, deleted when it goes off.
`<agent>-sandbox-metadata-deny` NetworkPolicy is left alone deliberately. It is
a guardrail rather than a workload, and invariant C5 forbids this controller
deleting a guardrail it did not create, so a cluster operator who applies that
policy by hand can rely on it surviving a reconcile. A stale NetworkPolicy
fails closed; a stale Deployment does not, which is why the two are treated
differently.

The credential-sidecar image contains Envoy, the real credential-aware CLIs,
and the credential runtime. The sandbox image contains only the wrappers for
those CLI names.

## Tradeoffs

Benefits:

- one Deployment and one Pod lifecycle;
- no managed credential env or files in the sandbox container;
- no separate proxy Service or cross-Pod availability coordination;
- a single local surface for CLI and chat policy; and
- credentials remain usable without adding real cloud CLIs to the sandbox.

Costs:

- no hard network or identity boundary between the sandbox and sidecar;
- a custom command-forwarding protocol must be maintained;
- interactive, streaming, and file-based CLI behavior is limited;
- configuration files the sandbox supplies to a credentialed command must be
  regenerated rather than read, which bounds them to what the sidecar can
  reproduce — for kubeconfigs, GKE contexts only; and
- each new service needs an explicit proxy integration and policy.

If deliberate metadata or Pod-identity access becomes in scope, this design
must return to separate Pods or use a node/runtime mechanism that enforces
per-container network identity.

## Verification

CI and deployment tests should assert that:

1. the sandbox has no Secret-backed env, `spec.deployment.env`, secret volume,
   or credential-state volume, and — in the sidecar layout — no ServiceAccount
   token mount. Under `splitCredentialBrokerPod: true` the sandbox mounts
   exactly one token, the broker-audience projection, and still none of the
   rest;
2. only the credential sidecar mounts proxy identity/state, and only the event
   watcher mounts its Kubernetes-API token projection;
3. only the credential sidecar receives Slack tokens and deployment env;
4. wrapper URLs resolve to `127.0.0.1:8765` in the sidecar layout, and to
   `http://<agent>-credential-proxy.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8765` when
   `splitCredentialBrokerPod` is enabled;
5. Envoy can reach the Unix-socket backend and `/healthz` reflects both;
6. unsupported executables, raw shell requests, and blocked disclosure commands
   fail closed;
7. a command given an agent-authored kubeconfig runs against a regenerated one,
   with no `exec`, `server`, `proxy-url`, or `tokenFile` value from the supplied
   document reaching it, whether it arrives through `KUBECONFIG` or
   `--kubeconfig`;
8. the `<agent>-credential-proxy` Deployment and Service are absent after
   reconciliation in the sidecar layout, and present under
   `splitCredentialBrokerPod: true` — the name is reconciled in both
   directions, not unconditionally removed. The `<agent>-sandbox`
   Deployment and ServiceAccount are absent in every configuration, and
   `<agent>-sandbox-metadata-deny` survives a reconcile that does not create
   it;
9. the external PlatformAgent API key is accepted by the sidecar and replaced
   before forwarding to the loopback-only sandbox API; and
10. Pod readiness fails when either Envoy or the credential runtime fails.
