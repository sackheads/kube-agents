    single identity that can read every cluster in the project. Set [] to
    provision no pool and keep the previous single-identity behaviour.

    Two things follow from a non-empty list, and both are intended. The agent's
    own service account drops roles/container.viewer, so it can enumerate
    clusters and fetch credentials but cannot read anything inside one. And the
    credential broker is handed the resulting mapping and armed, so a request
    naming a cluster that is not in this list is refused rather than served by a
    wider credential.

    Adding a cluster from another project is a row here; nothing else changes.
