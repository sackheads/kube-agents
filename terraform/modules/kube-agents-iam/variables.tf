    Project-level IAM roles granted to the agent's service account. Leave unset
    (or pass null, which lets a root module expose a passthrough variable) to
    take the computed default; set [] to grant nothing and manage roles
    elsewhere. See the security-and-iam reference for what each role is for.

    The computed default depends on scoped_clusters, and the coupling is
    deliberate. With no pool the agent's own identity is the only thing that can
    read Kubernetes objects, so it keeps roles/container.viewer. With a pool the
    per-cluster accounts carry that authority and the agent drops it, leaving
    roles/container.clusterViewer -- enough to enumerate the fleet and run
    `get-credentials`, not enough to read anything inside a cluster.

    Coupled rather than independent because the two changes are only safe
    together: narrowing the agent while the pool is empty breaks every read,
    and arming the pool while the agent stays wide leaves the ceiling the pool
    exists to remove. A deployment that wants a different answer names its
    roles explicitly, which is the supported path and always wins.

variable "scoped_clusters" {

    GKE clusters to provision a scoped reader service account for -- one account
    per cluster, holding roles/container.viewer under an IAM Condition on that
    cluster's resource.name. Empty (the default) provisions no pool and leaves
    the agent's single wide identity in place, which is the pre-existing
    behaviour.

    Cardinality is per (project, location, cluster) and not per scope tier,
    because the cluster is the only tier IAM can express: namespace is not an
    IAM concept and belongs to RBAC, and "fleet" is the unconditioned grant this
    is removing. project_id is per entry rather than inherited so that a cluster
    in another project is a row in this list rather than a second module.

    Every cluster the agent is expected to read must appear here. One that does
    not is refused by the broker rather than served by a wider credential, which
    is intended -- but it means this list and the live fleet are two things that
    can drift, and the drift shows up as a refusal.
