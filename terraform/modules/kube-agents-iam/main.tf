  # Container API control plane -- listing clusters, `get-credentials` -- and
  # nothing inside a cluster.
  #
  # That residual matters more than it looks. The metadata server is reachable
  # from the agent container in a default install, so the agent can mint a token
  # for this identity whenever it likes, entirely outside the broker. Shrinking
  # what that token is worth is the only control that survives the bypass.
