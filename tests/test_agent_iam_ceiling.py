"""The IAM ceiling the agent GSA is provisioned with.

GKE authorizes a request if EITHER IAM or Kubernetes RBAC allows it. The agent's
Kubernetes RBAC is read-only, but that constrains only one half of the union: a
GSA holding `roles/container.admin` is authorized by IAM no matter how narrow the
KSA is. `roles/container.admin` also carries `container.clusters.impersonate`,
and IAM has no `resourceNames` equivalent, so the grant cannot be scoped to a
cluster or a principal.

The provisioner used to offer that as one word, `PLATFORM_AGENT_PERMISSION_SET=gke-admin`.
These tests are what keeps it gone. They run the real bash — `common.sh` sourced,
`get_platform_agent_roles` lifted out of `provision_04_gcp_iam.sh` — rather than
grepping for a string, so re-adding the bundle under a different arm name is
caught by the accepted-value test even if the role list is spelled differently.

`custom` remains, so a deployment that needs broad roles still has a path; it just
has to name each role. That is deliberately not tested as "safe" — a `custom` set
can grant anything. What is tested is that no *built-in* set does.

Run:
  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_agent_iam_ceiling.py' -v
