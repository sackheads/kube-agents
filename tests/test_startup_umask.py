"""The umask that keeps the shared PVC writable from both containers.

The sandbox runs as UID 10000 and the credential sidecar as 10001 (see the UID
constants in the operator's `platformagent_manifests.go`). They share one PVC and
each writes files the other has to change: the sandbox creates the leased GitOps
directory the sidecar clones into, and the sidecar writes a kubeconfig pin into a
profile home the sandbox created. The kubelet's fsGroup pass makes files that
exist at mount time group-writable; for files created afterwards, the only thing
standing between the UID split and `EACCES` is that both sides run with
`umask 0002`.

That makes these three lines a control, and a control with no test is a control
that gets deleted. Deleting any one of them leaves every other suite in this
repository green and breaks the GitOps flow at runtime, in a way that shows up as
a skill failing to clone rather than as anything pointing back here.

There are three of them rather than two because a `replicas > 1` PlatformAgent
never runs `agent-entrypoint` at all: the operator gives the sandbox container a
`command`, which overrides the image ENTRYPOINT, and `leader_elect.py` starts
Hermes itself.

Run:
  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_startup_umask.py' -v
