"""E2E: the credential boundary between the sandbox and the credential broker.

REQUIRES A LIVE CLUSTER. There is no CI job for this file and there cannot be a
useful one without a running agent Pod: every assertion here is about what the
kernel shows one container about another, which is precisely the thing a
rendered manifest cannot tell you. The operator's Go tests assert the inputs --
`shareProcessNamespace` unset, split UIDs, broker-private volumes -- and this
asserts the consequence.

It is deliberately cheap to run compared with agentplugins_e2e_test.py: no image
build, no registry, no writes of any kind. It reads `/proc` and runs `id`. It
does not modify the namespace and is safe against a cluster you care about.

    NAMESPACE=kubeagents-system \\
    python3 tests/e2e/operator/credential_isolation_e2e_test.py

Exit status 0 means every check passed. Any failure prints the check that failed
and exits 1.

Why each check exists:

  1. A shared process namespace puts the broker's /proc/<pid>/environ -- where
     its credentials are -- inside a directory the sandbox can read, and that is
     reachable by a prompt-injected model with no process compromise at all. The
     manifest field was removed in slice 2b; these two checks are what prove the
     runtime followed. `shareProcessNamespace: true` is observable from inside a
     container in two ways, and both are asserted, because either could be true
     while the other is masked by a CRI quirk: PID 1 becomes the infra
     ("pause") process rather than the container's own entrypoint, and the
     broker's processes become visible in the agent's /proc.

  2. The two controls are independent and both are needed. Reading another
     process's /proc/<pid>/environ takes ptrace-level access, which the kernel
     grants on a uid match; seeing the pid at all takes a shared namespace.
     Splitting the UIDs removes the first even if the namespace ever comes
     back, which is why the UIDs are checked here and not only at render time.

  3. The broker's HOME and its backend socket directory are on emptyDirs the
     agent container does not mount. kubectl reads $HOME/.kube/kuberc with no
     flag at all and a kuberc can set `as`, so a writable broker HOME is
     caller-supplied impersonation through a file. The render-time half of this
     is pinned in platformagent_broker_home_test.go; this is the runtime half.
