"""Could the harness itself be the thing that passes?

Slice 2a shipped a whole gate that could be deleted with its test suite
byte-identical. Slice 2b's task 5 reported mutation results from a stub harness
and part of the transcript turned out to be fiction -- the harness injected a
return code at a layer that could not model the behaviour it claimed to test.
Both times the question that would have caught it was asked late or by
accident.

So it is asked here, first, every run. Everything in this module is about the
suite rather than about the product:

  * every artifact a test reads exists, is non-empty, and still contains the
    anchor that makes reading it meaningful
  * the modules the suite imports are the ones that ship
  * every expected failure is registered with an invariant and a reference
  * the bucket-2 scenarios are skipped for the stated reason and not because
    they failed to load
