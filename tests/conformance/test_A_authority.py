        Without `escalate`, the API server refuses to let the operator create a
        role granting permissions the operator does not itself hold. With it,
        the ceiling in C5 is advisory.

        `bind` is the third escalation verb and the operator holds one, on
        `system:auth-delegator` by name: it is how the auth callout gets to
        create TokenReviews. Note what that grant is NOT -- it is not a
        substitute for `clusterroles: create`, which the operator holds
        unscoped, per the first line of this docstring. It is needed because
        `system:auth-delegator` also grants `subjectaccessreviews: create`,
        which the operator does not hold, so the escalation check refuses the
        binding without it. What makes it safe is the `resourceNames` scope, so
        that is what is asserted -- an unrestricted `bind` lets the operator
        attach any existing role, `cluster-admin` included, to anything it can
        create a binding for.
